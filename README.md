# Better-Movie-finder
Better version of [Moive-finder](https://github.com/TorhamDev/Movie-finder/)


Is a scraper script to search for movies and find movie download links from my **favorite** movie website (**avamovie**). As a result, I don't need to open the browser to find and download the movie! XD

## Demo :)

Run the following commands in order
```bash
# clone the project in your local
git clone https://github.com/TorhamDev/Movie-finder.git

# install dependencies
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# run the main.py 
python src/main.py

# Enjoy :)
```
